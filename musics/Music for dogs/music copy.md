Lyrics: [Verse 1]
Sunrise creeping, sleepy sigh
Got those big bat ears and one blue eye
A little snort, a happy sneeze
Ready to do just what I please
Waddle to the kitchen, short legs on the floor
Waiting by my food bowl, asking for some more

[Chorus]
I'm a little potato, short and stout
Hear my happy grumbles when I'm out and about
A sunny spot is where I'll be found
The happiest little creature in this whole town
A wiggle and a snuffle, a heart full of love
A funny-faced angel from somewhere above

[Verse 2]
The toys are squeaking, it's time to play
Gonna chase that fluffy thing all day
A sudden stop, a goofy grin
Then find a comfy spot to settle in
The world outside is fast and grand
But a nap on the sofa is what I've planned

[Chorus]
I'm a little potato, short and stout
Hear my happy grumbles when I'm out and about
A sunny spot is where I'll be found
The happiest little creature in this whole town
A wiggle and a snuffle, a heart full of love
A funny-faced angel from somewhere above

[Bridge]
Dreaming of fields and tasty treats
Of friendly faces and tapping feet
A gentle breeze, a passing cloud
Snoring softly, but ever so proud

[Outro]
Yeah, ever so proud
A little snore, another sigh
Just a happy bulldog, watch the world go by
Watch the world go by... zzzz

[Verse 1]
Sunrise paints the window pane
I hear the birds outside again
A gentle nudge with a wet nose
That's just the way the morning goes
Leash is hanging by the door
Can't sit still for a moment more
My tail is knocking on the floor
Let's go and see what's in store

[Chorus]
Oh, the yellow ball is thrown, I'm a flash of gold and speed
Living out my happiest, simplest creed
Through the open fields, I run so fast and free
Just a loyal friend, that's the heart of me
With a splash in the water, and a shake in the sun
The adventure's never over, the fun has just begun

[Verse 2]
The car door opens, what a treat
A hundred different smells to greet
My head is out, the wind is loud
I'm the happiest creature in the crowd
A stick is floating in the lake
For goodness and for chasing sake
A mighty leap, a joyful dive
I've never felt so much alive

[Chorus]
Oh, the yellow ball is thrown, I'm a flash of gold and speed
Living out my happiest, simplest creed
Through the open fields, I run so fast and free

With a splash in the water, and a shake in the sun
The adventure's never over, the fun has just begun

[Bridge]
The day gets long, the sun is low
It's time for home, it's time to go
I'll curl up right beside your feet
A happy sigh, a love so sweet
Tired paws but a happy soul
You make my whole wide world feel whole

[Outro]
Yeah, you make me whole
A final wag, a sleepy gaze
For all my wild and happy days
My happy days... my happy days.

First light creeping on the floor
I'm waiting here beside the door

To start another perfect day
My patient eyes, they watch and gleam
Living in a happy dream
Just a soft nudge of my head
Time to get out of that bed

[Chorus]
I've got a heart of solid gold
A story waiting to unfold
Through fields of green, I'll run with you

On me, you always can depend

[Verse 2]
The old red ball has lost its squeak
But it's the only thing I seek

And play until the day is done
I'll bring it back a hundred times
For gentle praise and happy chimes
Of laughter ringing in the air
To show you how much I care

I've got a heart of solid gold
A story waiting to unfold
Through fields of green, I'll run with you

Just a happy soul, a loyal friend
On me, you always can depend

[Bridge]
And when the evening starts to fall
And quiet settles over all
My sleepy head will find a knee
For all the family to see
A gentle sigh, a peaceful rest
Knowing that my life is blessed

[Outro]
Yeah, my life is blessed
A loyal friend until the end
On me, you always can depend
Always can depend... always.

A silhouette against the night
Everything will be alright
I stand my post, I walk the line
Because this family is mine

[Chorus]
I am the watcher, brave and true
My life's whole purpose is for you

I'm not just guard, I am a friend

The strength and speed, the focused pace
They do not know the softer side
The gentle heart I hold inside
That rests its head upon your feet
A love so simple and complete

[Outro]
Always on watch...
Always on guard...
Forever yours...
Your faithful heart...
Always.

Observe the walk, a certain prance
I don't leave anything to chance
My coat is curled, my head held high
As all the passers-by walk by
I step so lightly on my feet
Down every sophisticated street
I'm poetry in motion, see?
A living piece of topiary

[Chorus]
Oh, I am beauty, I am brains
I love the opera when it rains
I'm not just fluff, I'm not just hair
I've got a clever, knowing stare
A work of art from nose to tail
A puzzle you will never fail
To be impressed by, it's my curse
To be the smartest in the universe

[Verse 2]
I hear the words you think are deep
I know the secrets that you keep
I solve the puzzle of the door
I've seen this kind of thing before
You think you're teaching me a trick
My mind is moving twice as quick
I'll do it for the tasty prize
But you can see it in my eyes

[Chorus]
Oh, I am beauty, I am brains
I love the opera when it rains
I'm not just fluff, I'm not just hair
I've got a clever, knowing stare
A work of art from nose to tail
A puzzle you will never fail
To be impressed by, it's my curse
To be the smartest in the universe

[Bridge]
But when the busy day is done
And there's no more need to stun
The crowd with my superior grace
I love my quiet, special place
I'll lay my head upon a shoe
And prove my loyalty to you
Beneath the style, a heart beats true

[Outro]
Oh yes, a heart that beats for you
So chic, so smart, it's all an art
Yes, it's an art, right from the start
C'est moi. The finest work of art.

I see a king who's in the know
This special view is all my own
From my magnificent, low-slung throne

[Chorus]
Oh! I'm long, I'm low, I'm ready to go!
A four-legged engine, putting on a show

I know that I am good enough!

[Verse 2]
The blankets on the bed are deep
A perfect fortress where I'll sleep
I'll burrow down and disappear
And banish every single fear
I take my walks with mighty pride
There ain't no place for me to hide
My little legs, they move so fast
I wasn't built to come in last

[Chorus]
Oh! I'm long, I'm low, I'm ready to go!
A four-legged engine, putting on a show
With the heart of a lion, and a stubborn streak
The greatest treasure that you'll ever seek
My bark is loud, my spirit's tough
I know that I am good enough!

[Bridge]
You might just chuckle at my size
But look into my clever eyes
I am a hunter, bold and grand
The loyal ruler of this land
This funny shape is my design
This whole entire house is mine

[Outro]
Yeah, the house is mine!
Long and low, what a show!
Here I go!
Woof!

[Verse 1]
The back door opens, I'm awake
A thousand promises to make
The grass is damp, the air is new
A million stories passing through
My ears are long, they flop and fly
But they're not how I see the sky
The world is made of wondrous smells
My nose has epic tales it tells

[Chorus]
My nose is down, my tail is high
A brand new trail is passing by
You call my name, a distant sound
But oh, the story I have found!
Arooo! Arooo! The trail is hot and new!
Arooo! Arooo! This is what I'm born to do!

[Verse 2]
A rabbit passed here yesterday
I have to know which way he strayed
A fallen leaf, a patch of dirt
I'm on the case, I'm on alert
Through tangled briar, mud, and streams
I'm living out my wildest dreams
A single thought directs my feet
This clue is way too good to eat!

[Chorus]
My nose is down, my tail is high
A brand new trail is passing by
You call my name, a distant sound
But oh, the story I have found!
Arooo! Arooo! The trail is hot and new!
Arooo! Arooo! This is what I'm born to do!

[Bridge]
I know I'm meant to walk with you
Be a good companion, tried and true
But this whole world is in the breeze
It whispers through the rustling trees
My heart is yours, but you must know
My nose decides which way we go

[Outro]
Which way to go...
The trail is new...
Arooo! Arooo!
Just one more sniff...
Arooo!

[Verse 1]
A shadow in the corner, still
I'm standing by the window sill
My quiet breath, a steady pace
The loyal guardian of this space
I don't need bark, I don't need fuss
There is a silent strength in us
This house is mine to watch and keep
While all the ones I love are fast asleep

[Chorus]
I wear a coat of black and rust
Inside this chest, a heart you trust
I am the calm within the storm
The one who's here to keep you warm
A heavy head placed on your knee
The only softness you will see
I am your rock, your anchor chain
Through sun and shadow, wind and rain

[Verse 2]
A happy grumble, low and deep
A secret promise that I'll keep
The silly games, the clumsy leap
Are treasures that are buried deep
For you, I'm just a gentle clown
The safest soul in this whole town
But when a stranger comes to call
I am a solid, living wall

[Chorus]
I wear a coat of black and rust
Inside this chest, a heart you trust
I am the calm within the storm
The one who's here to keep you warm
A heavy head placed on your knee
The only softness you will see
I am your rock, your anchor chain
Through sun and shadow, wind and rain

[Bridge]
The world may see a fearsome might
They do not see my inner light
They do not feel this steady soul
Whose only goal is making you whole
They only see the strength I wear
They do not see the love I bear

[Outro]
Always here.
Always watching.
Always yours.
Your anchor chain.
Always.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lye5GBkb1uI&list=OLAK5uy_nLCBYNrJuVX1UK-CPmhk9jh6sAoA3ztxk&index=9
A slow and heavy blues rock groove with a swampy, shuffling rhythm, The track is driven by a thick, fuzzy, and simple electric guitar riff and a heavy-handed, minimalist drum beat, The bass is fat and lazy, perfectly in the pocket, The lead vocal is a deep, gruff male baritone with a loveably grumpy and relaxed delivery, Occasional snores and snorts can be used as percussion, The overall mood is stubborn, sleepy, and surprisingly sweet, like a loyal, wrinkly companion who refuses to move from the best spot on the sofa
[Verse 1]
Got my spot here on the couch
I'm a certified, professional slouch
The sunbeam's moved about a foot
I guess I'll have to stay right put
This underbite, this wrinkled brow
It's all the fashion here and now
I hear you call, a distant plea
But this old cushion's holding me

[Chorus]
I've got a shuffle in my walk
A low grumble in my sleepy talk
You think I'm grumpy, that's my charm
I'll never, ever do you harm
This wrinkled face, a heart of gold
A stubborn story to be told
Yeah, a stubborn story, brave and old

[Verse 2]
The food bowl's full, I heard the sound
The greatest treasure to be found
I'll make the journey, slow and wide
With my distinctive, rolling stride
I'll eat it fast, a happy snort
My daily dose of active sport
And then it's back to claim my place
With dignity and sleepy grace

[Chorus]
I've got a shuffle in my walk
A low grumble in my sleepy talk
You think I'm grumpy, that's my charm
I'll never, ever do you harm
This wrinkled face, a heart of gold
A stubborn story to be told
Yeah, a stubborn story, brave and old

[Bridge]
But when you're sad, I'll know the score
I'll shuffle right across the floor
I won't do tricks, I won't play fetch
I'm not that kind of happy wretch
I'll just sit here beside your feet
A loyal, heavy, calming feat

[Outro]
My work is done... it's time to dream
Of biscuits flowing in a stream
A final snuffle, then a snore
Couldn't ask for anything more...
*snore*... anything more... *grumble*...

[Verse 1]
The sun is up, I'm at the door
Can't be inside anymore
A million miles are in my legs
My happy, hopeful heart just begs
For open space and skies so wide
There is no place for me to hide
My body's just a coiled spring
Ready for what the day will bring

[Chorus]
I run, I run, a spotted blur
A high-speed engine in the fur
Through fields of gold and skies of blue
Until I find a scent that's new
Then everything just disappears
I silence all my wildest fears
One leg is up, my body's tight
A perfect, silent, living sight

[Verse 2]
I'll check back in, a happy glance
This isn't just a random dance
You are my partner, you're my guide
I'm always running by your side
We're in this game, just me and you
The greatest team, the perfect two
You throw the ball, I bring it back
I'm on the scent, I'm on the track

[Chorus]
I run, I run, a spotted blur
A high-speed engine in the fur
Through fields of gold and skies of blue
Until I find a scent that's new
Then everything just disappears
I silence all my wildest fears
One leg is up, my body's tight
A perfect, silent, living sight

[Bridge]
The wind just stops, the birds are still
A sudden focus, what a thrill
Every muscle, every thought
For this one moment I was taught
The world goes quiet, holds its breath
A silent victory over death

[Outro]
And then I break! And run again!
The greatest game will never end!
Again, again, let's go again!
This feeling never has to end!
On and on and on and on...
