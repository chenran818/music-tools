  "title": "I'm Here to Change the World",
  "style": "Epic cinematic style with a rising orchestral build: deep , rhythmic percussion , haunting choirs , dramatic strings , and synth pulses; crescendo to a thunderous peak , then fade with soft piano and ether",
  "lyrics": "(Verse 1)\nI stepped off the plane with a spark in my eye,\nThe valley was waiting under that open sky.\nFrom garage dreams to billion-dollar schemes,\nThe world’s on fire, fueled by these dreams.\n\nStarted with code, just a screen and a goal,\nTurning vision into something to console.\nTracy built tools for the builders to thrive,\nAustin made cars see and come alive.\n\n(Pre-Chorus)\nThis is the land where the bold collide,\nFailures are lessons, and hope’s our guide.\nIn a place where a day feels like a year,\nYou rise above or disappear.\n\n(Chorus)\nI am here to change the world,\nWith every line of code, a flag unfurled.\nSilicon stars in the digital stream,\nBuilding tomorrow from a daring dream.\n\n(Verse 2)\nWang tagged data for machines to see,\nPulse came alive at Stanford’s marquee.\nFrom immigrant grit to the heights of might,\nDreams don’t sleep in the valley at night.\n\nJohn’s RISC changed the game for all,\nWhile Sundar and Satya answered the call.\nA network of vision, connections that grow,\nIn the Valley’s orbit, the whole world glows.\n\n(Pre-Chorus)\nRisk is a culture, failure’s a rite,\nWe aim for the stars, no ceiling in sight.\nIn this bubble of genius, the pressure’s real,\nThe grind reveals what you conceal.\n\n(Chorus)\nI am here to change the world,\nThrough sleepless nights and dreams unfurled.\nCoding the future, one step at a time,\nInnovation's anthem, my life in rhyme.\n\n(Bridge)\nThey say the rent is high, but the stakes are higher,\nThe dreams here burn like a wildfire.\nCoffee-fueled mornings, pitch-filled nights,\nIn the heart of the Valley, we chase the heights.\n\n(Chorus)\nI am here to change the world,\nA fearless heart in the chaos swirled.\nBuilding the future with hope as my guide,\nSilicon Valley, my place, my pride.\n\n(Outro)\nSomeday they’ll say, “They changed the game,”\nBut it’s not for the glory, it’s not for the fame.\nA day is a year in the Valley’s glow,\nI am here to change the world, and let it show."

  "title": "No Windshield Survives San Francisco",
  "style": null,
  "lyrics": "Verse 1\nOn the far west coast, there’s a city so bold,\nPunishing past lives, or so the stories are told.\nFriday rush, shopping bags in hand,\nLocked the doors, closed the trunk, came back to shattered plans.\n\nPre-Chorus\nPolice just shrug, \"This happens all the time,\"\nBroken glass carpets the streets, it’s a city crime.\n\nChorus\nNo windshield survives the streets of this town,\nShards of glass rain where shadows come down.\nAt every red light, trouble’s disguised,\nSan Francisco lives where no car survives.\n\nVerse 2\nA friend came to see the Golden Gate glow,\nPacked their passport, laptop, and dreams in tow.\nBut at a red light, the smash came fast,\nTheir hopes left shattered in a trunkless past.\n\nPre-Chorus\nPoliticians blamed, cops shake their heads,\nResidents adapt, fear lies ahead.\n\nChorus\nNo windshield survives the streets of this town,\nShards of glass rain where shadows come down.\nAt every red light, trouble’s disguised,\nSan Francisco lives where no car survives.\n\nBridge\nWindows rolled down, hoping to keep thieves at bay,\nBut absurdities rise, like a joke gone astray.\nFrom falling high-rise glass to the cost of repairs,\nTesla drivers sigh as frustration flares.\n\nVerse 3\nLake Street’s night of endless broken panes,\nA silent war waged on car window frames.\nThe city’s beauty hides a darker strife,\nWhere shattered glass tells the story of life.\n\nPre-Chorus\nDreams collide with chaos, hope turns thin,\nThis is the city where survival wears thin.\n\nChorus\nNo windshield survives the streets of this town,\nShards of glass rain where shadows come down.\nAt every red light, trouble’s disguised,\nSan Francisco lives where no car survives.\n\nOutro\nThe wind whistles softly through broken glass scars,\nA city of ambition, but it’s written in the stars.\nMaybe one day this madness will fade,\nBut for now, the streets are where the rules are unmade."

  "title": "Startup Is Not Always Fun",
  "style": null,
  "lyrics": "Verse 1\nIn the heart of San Francisco, where AI runs wild,\nBig Data whispers secrets, Web3 beguiles.\nHalf my salary’s a ghost, spent on a room so small,\nLiving Cloud dreams, chasing SaaS calls.\n\nPre-Chorus\nNo savings, no rest, just a hustle in disguise,\nMetaverse promises but the cost multiplies.\n\nChorus\nLiving on the edge of GenAI dreams,\nBuilding worlds in Blockchain streams.\nWhere LLMs write the future untold,\nSan Francisco sings a struggle of gold.\n\nVerse 2\nEighty-hour weeks in a SaaS-powered grind,\nYour startup’s your temple, your soul’s left behind.\nLLMs build your pitch; investors want more,\nWeb3's the frontier, but it’s a digital war.\n\nPre-Chorus\nCompetition’s fierce, uncertainty’s the game,\nVenture funds chase buzzwords, but it feels the same.\n\nChorus\nLiving on the edge of GenAI dreams,\nBuilding worlds in Blockchain streams.\nWhere LLMs write the future untold,\nSan Francisco sings a struggle of gold.\n\nBridge\nMetaverse meetings where avatars glow,\nBut the city’s streets tell stories of woe.\nCrack needles on sidewalks, car windows smashed,\nIn this Cloud of ambition, some dreams don’t last.\n\nVerse 3\nAI innovations but isolation remains,\nYour identity’s SaaS, and it’s chained to the game.\nFounders chasing funding like it’s organized crime,\nGenAI scripts success, but we’re running out of time.\n\nPre-Chorus\nWe trade our lives for visions, for a chance to create,\nBlockchain might save us—but is it too late?\n\nChorus\nLiving on the edge of GenAI dreams,\nBuilding worlds in Blockchain streams.\nWhere LLMs write the future untold,\nSan Francisco sings a struggle of gold.\n\nOutro\nA day is a year in Silicon Valley’s maze,\nIn AI's shadow, we hope for brighter days.\nFor every crack in the pavement, a spark still glows,\nIn the city of tech, where the struggle shows."

  "title": "Why Is San Jose So Boring?",
  "style": null,
  "lyrics": "Intro (Spoken Word)\n\"They call it the capital of Silicon Valley,\nBut after 8 PM, it’s just a ghost town alley.\"\n\nVerse 1 (Haiku Structure)\nSprawling neighborhoods,\nVacant streets and quiet nights,\nDreams in cul-de-sacs.\n\nNo city skyline,\nJust endless strip malls and roads,\nWhere’s the beating heart?\n\nChorus (Call and Response Style)\nCall: Why’s San Jose so quiet, so tame?\nResponse: No buzz, no beat—it’s all the same.\nCall: The rent’s sky-high, but the fun’s so low,\nResponse: Pack your bags; we’re off to San Francisco!\n\nBridge (List Poem Structure with Rhythmic Repetition)\nSanta Clara Street’s got shops that are bare,\nLight rail’s late, and no one’s there.\nNightlife’s chill, not a vibe you’ll crave,\nJust a quiet drink if you’re feeling brave.\n\nFamilies thrive, but singles flee,\nTo Campbell bars or SF streets.\nHomeless camps in the city square,\nEcho dreams of what could be there.\n\nVerse 2 (Spoken-Word Narrative with Rhyme)\nAlfredo’s menswear shop downtown is fading,\nFoot traffic’s gone, and the rent keeps inflating.\nHe says, “Why stay? No one shops, just strolls,\nDowntown San Jose has lost its soul.”\n\nReddit threads full of desperate pleas,\n“Is there anywhere fun in this town, please?”\nThey say, \"Drive north; don’t waste your night,\nSan Jose’s dull, but SF’s alight.\"\n\nChorus (Call and Response Style)\nCall: Why’s San Jose so quiet, so tame?\nResponse: No buzz, no beat—it’s all the same.\nCall: The rent’s sky-high, but the fun’s so low,\nResponse: Pack your bags; we’re off to San Francisco!\n\nOutro (Contrasting Tone)\nBut maybe boring ain’t so bad,\nFor families here, life’s not so sad.\nA suburban town where dreams are made,\nJust not the kind that loves a parade."

  "title": "Algorithm of Love",
  "style": "A fusion of ethereal synthwave and organic percussion , blending dreamy electronic textures with rhythmic world beats , Evokes introspection , motion , and quiet power",
  "lyrics": "Verse 1\nIn the land of code and chips, where ambitions soar,\nDating feels like debugging, an eternal chore.\nMen outnumber women, it’s a numbers game,\nBut finding true connection? That’s harder to claim.\n\nPre-Chorus\nSwipe left, swipe right, is there more to see?\nProfiles read like résumés, no authenticity.\n\"Odds are good, but the goods are odd,\" they say,\nAnother date, another startup pitch underway.\n\nChorus\nWelcome to Silicon Valley, where love’s a prototype,\nA/B testing romance in the glow of screens at night.\nOptimizing feelings, overanalyzed and raw,\nBut hearts aren’t algorithms, they don’t follow laws.\n\nVerse 2\nHe brought a telescope, said, \"Let’s watch the stars,\"\nForgot it was daylight, we stayed by our cars.\nPockets full of Starburst, energy drinks in hand,\nAwkward yet endearing, like only tech bros can.\n\nPre-Chorus\n\"Let’s align our OKRs,\" he said with a grin,\n\"Quarterly reviews to track how we’ve been.\"\nBut love’s not a product, there’s no launch event,\nJust two souls searching for what’s meant.\n\nChorus\nWelcome to Silicon Valley, where love’s a prototype,\nA/B testing romance in the glow of screens at night.\nOptimizing feelings, overanalyzed and raw,\nBut hearts aren’t algorithms, they don’t follow laws.\n\nBridge\nAt a lingerie café, cards with friends in play,\nHe didn’t ask if I’d be okay.\nThe tech world’s quirky, the dating scene’s wild,\nFrom NFTs to Red Bulls, it’s a strange lifestyle.\n\nChorus\nWelcome to Silicon Valley, where love’s a prototype,\nA/B testing romance in the glow of screens at night.\nOptimizing feelings, overanalyzed and raw,\nBut hearts aren’t algorithms, they don’t follow laws.\n\nOutro\nSo here’s to the awkward, the weird, the sincere,\nThe dates that went sideways, but taught us to persevere.\nIn Silicon Valley, love may take its own route,\nBut even in the chaos, it’s worth figuring out."

  "lyrics": "(Verse 1)\nIn the heart of the Bay where dreams ignite,\nDot-com boomed, then fell from the heights.\nPets.com, Webvan, they disappeared,\nEchoes of layoffs through twenty years.\n\nCisco lights dimmed, HP slashed deep,\nThe valleys of promise saw many weep.\nFinancial crises, jobs turned to dust,\nYet still, we rise, rebuild, and trust.\n\n(Chorus)\nOh, the valley hums with hope and despair,\nLayoffs linger, ghosts in the air.\nBut through the cuts, the fire still burns,\nIn Silicon Valley, the wheel always turns.\n\n(Verse 2)\nThe 2010s brought growth and pride,\nStartups soared, big names thrived.\nBut Yahoo stumbled, HP fell,\nBehind the glamour, a quiet farewell.\n\nPandemic struck, demand went high,\nTech expanded, reaching the sky.\nBut when the world healed, they let us go,\nMeta, Google, Tesla’s blow.\n\n(Chorus)\nOh, the valley hums with hope and despair,\nLayoffs linger, ghosts in the air.\nBut through the cuts, the fire still burns,\nIn Silicon Valley, the wheel always turns.\n\n(Bridge)\nTanya’s tears on a sleepless night,\nMortgage bills in the harsh daylight.\nCommunity rallied, her daughter stood tall,\nFrom broken dreams, she rebuilt it all.\n\n(Verse 3)\nDowntowns empty, shops closed their doors,\nRipple effects to the Bay’s core.\nFrom the ashes, a story to tell,\nOf strength and spirit, of rising well.\n\n(Outro)\nSo here’s to the dreamers who still remain,\nTo those rebuilding through the pain.\nSilicon Valley, a day feels a year,\nBut hope and resilience persevere."

  "style": null,
  "lyrics": "Intro (Monologue Spoken Over a Chill Groove)\n\"They call it coasting. Not climbing, not falling—just staying in the game.\nLevel 5’s my sweet spot; the trick is staying invisible. Watch and learn.\"\n\nVerse 1 (Free-Form Narrative with Rhyming Couplets)\nThey hired me for vision, but I keep it clear,\nNo big ideas, just a nod and a cheer.\nMeetings on mute, I don’t say a word,\nInvisible genius—it’s how I’m preferred.\n\nI mastered the art of blending in plain sight,\nDeliver just enough, never too bright.\nThe juniors hustle, the execs play chess,\nMe? I’m the guy who’s causing no stress.\n\nChorus (Refrain with List-Like Flow)\nLevel 5, where the stakes are low,\nNo KPIs, just a steady flow.\nSkip the grind, no burnout here,\nRetiring slow, year by year.\n\nBridge 1 (Humorous, Narrative Break with Shift in Tempo)\nThey think I’m busy, but here’s the scoop:\nSpreadsheet open, I’m playing Sudoku.\nSlack says “active,” my desk’s on display,\nBut I’m Googling flights to Monterey Bay.\n\nVerse 2 (Structure Shift to Highlight Boredom and Strategy)\nI’m not the rookie chasing dreams of gold,\nNor the exec, burned out and cold.\nMy badge still scans; my title’s the same,\nJust riding the wave of this corporate game.\n\nSometimes I wonder if they even know,\nMy job’s a ghost town, my workload’s slow.\nBut layoffs come for the ones who shine,\nSo I dim my light and bide my time.\n\nChorus (Refrain with Repetition for Emphasis)\nLevel 5, where the stakes are low,\nNo KPIs, just a steady flow.\nSkip the grind, no burnout here,\nRetiring slow, year by year.\n\nBridge 2 (Philosophical Tone, Minor Key Shift)\nThey say ambition’s the key to thrive,\nBut what if balance keeps you alive?\nI’m not a star, but I’m not a ghost,\nI’m the guy they forget at the annual toast.\n\nOutro (Refrain with Fading Layers, Dreamy Synths)\nLevel 5, a quiet throne,\nNot too high, but all my own.\nInvisible hands, just coasting through,\nBig tech dreams with nothing to prove."
